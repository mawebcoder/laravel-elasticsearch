# laravel-elasticsearch (Elastiquent-PHP)

By using an Eloquent-like query builder, you can tame the beast without having to worry about Elasticsearch's monstrous syntax.

You can use this package if you are already familiar with Elasticsearch and want to save time by not having to memorize the higherarchical nested syntax.

As you would with migrations and models in Laravel, you can create and alter mappings and indices.

Those with a little more knowledge can also take advantage of so many advanced features of Elasticsearch in the package.

We will keep you updated on this amazing package in the future. :bomb: :sparkles: :computer:
